#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Young Scientist at Shanghai AI Laboratory. Currently, I closely collaborate with Prof. Yu Cheng, and work on the revolution of foundational model architecture, including algorithm and system co-innovations on Linear Sequence Modeling (Linear Attention) and Mixture-of-Experts.

See our research projects: [Linear-MoE](https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE), [Linearization](https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linearization) and [MoM](https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM) for technical details.

üî• ***I am looking for talented interns to work with me on above projects and beyond.*** Please feel free to hit me up with your CV or any questions if you are interested.

I earned my PhD degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) at 2020.04, jointly trained at School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation (AIA) and HUST Innovation Institute (with the First-class Grant). Before that, I received my B.E. degree from China University of Mining and Technology at 2015.06.
